        <h3>Bachelor's Final Thesis</h3>
        <p>This project is driven by a passion for plants and gardening and a desire to find a solution to struggles with keeping plants alive. I started having an Arduino in my house and me not knowing what I could do for my bachelor’s final thesis, so I came up with this project with the goal is to improve the success rate of gardening by accurately monitoring and controlling growing conditions, making it easier for people to grow and care for their plants. 
		    Project's Description: Design and implementation of a personal climate control system for plants using cloud computing and IoT technologies, with the aim of accurately monitoring and controlling the growing conditions of plants in a personal greenhouse.
