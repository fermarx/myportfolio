      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Xiao Fernandez and I am a recent graduate in Computer Science. I am passionate about programming and love to work on challenging projects that test my skills.
      As a recent Computer Science graduate, I possess a strong passion for technology and problem-solving skills that make me an excellent candidate for a challenging and dynamic role. 
		  During my studies, I gained experience in various programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++, and worked on group projects that honed my teamwork and communication skills. 
		  Additionally, my experience as an Erasmus+ exchange student in Norway allowed me to develop cultural awareness and adaptability. 
		  My Bachelor's final thesis project involved utilizing my skills and knowledge to contribute to projects that can make a positive impact. I am eager to begin my career and bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to a company that values innovation, collaboration, and growth.

          <h3>Bachelor's Final Thesis</h3>
          <p>This project is driven by a passion for plants and gardening and a desire to find a solution to struggles with keeping plants alive. I started having an Arduino in my house and me not knowing what I could do for my bachelor’s final thesis, so I came up with this project with the goal is to improve the success rate of gardening by accurately monitoring and controlling growing conditions, making it easier for people to grow and care for their plants. 
          Project's Description: Design and implementation of a personal climate control system for plants using cloud computing and IoT technologies, with the aim of accurately monitoring and controlling the growing conditions of plants in a personal greenhouse.
