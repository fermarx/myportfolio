    <!--About me-->
    <div id="about" class="content active">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Xiao Fernández Marín, a 23-year-old computer science graduate from Spain. You can call me Xiao. I'm passionate about technology, innovation, and cultural exploration. My journey in computer science has equipped me with practical skills in cloud computing, machine learning, and IoT. I'm excited to share my experiences and showcase how I've grown both professionally and personally.
      </p>
      
      <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I pursued a bilingual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM). I recently graduated with distinction, earning a grade of 9.5/10 for my Bachelor's thesis project. My project involved creating a personal climate control system for greenhouse plants using cloud computing and IoT technologies. It was a challenging endeavor that expanded my knowledge and problem-solving abilities.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>New Technology Consultant at Management Solutions (Nov 2022 - Jan 2023)</strong>: During my internship, I played a pivotal role in migrating a bank's fraud detection system to the cloud. This experience gave me hands-on exposure to cloud technology and machine learning implementation. I contributed to enhancing system efficiency and security through data transfer capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Junior Cloud Engineering at Openbank (Current)</strong>: I am currently working as a Junior Cloud Engineer at Openbank, specializing in AWS databases. I've developed scripts to streamline database management and have undergone AWS training courses. I am working towards obtaining my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification in the near future.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Passions Beyond Tech</h2>
      <p>
        Despite my technical interests, I have always had a desire to explore different cultures and help people. In 2017, I participated in a volunteering program in Germany where I helped to restore a walking path in the forest and learned carpentry skills while meeting people from different parts of the world. I also volunteered for a food bank in Spain, encouraging people to donate food to families in need. These experiences have fueled my passion for working in international environments, where diverse perspectives can lead to innovative problem-solving.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Erasmus+ Experience</h2>
      <p>
        As part of my bachelor's degree, I embarked on an Erasmus+ adventure to Norway, studying at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. This transformative experience not only expanded my horizons academically but also introduced me to the rich Norwegian culture and their deep connection with nature. It was a courageous move outside my comfort zone that I will always cherish.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Favorite Language</h2>
      <p>
        As a programmer, I do not have a single favorite programming language. My preference for a particular language depends on the specific project and its requirements. While I tend to enjoy object-oriented programming and have found great use for C in certain projects, I am open to exploring new programming languages and technologies as needed. During my bachelor's degree, I worked with a variety of programming languages, including Java, C++, C, Assembly, R, and Python, as well as SQL, Puppet, or VBA. This experience has given me a broad understanding of different programming paradigms and the ability to learn new languages quickly. I also completed several courses in Python, which I find to be a highly flexible language that is well-suited to a wide range of applications. My experience with multiple programming languages and my ability to adapt to the requirements of each project have made me a flexible and effective programmer. While I have enjoyed working with certain languages, I remain open to new opportunities and am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field of programming.

          <p><b>Context:</b> Course with theoretical and the laboratory part. All the lab part was done by pairs. <br>
          <b>Project's Description:</b> The goal of this course was to introduce us to AI. We learnt the basics of every algorithm. After this course, we had the one above, an optional course. Here we had to program a different project for each topic of the course. The first one was a pacman maze using min-max alpha strategy, alpha/beta pruning, the second one was to resolve the eight queens' problem using Prolog and the last one was about predictions using sklearn.
