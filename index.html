      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!--About me-->
      <p><b>Who am I?</b> <br>
      Hi! I am a 23-year-old girl from Spain called Sofia Xiao Fernandez Marin, preferably being called Xiao, and I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with hands-on experience in cloud computing, machine learning, and IoT, I am confident in my ability to excel in a role that would allow me to apply my skills and passion for innovation. <br>
      As I just completed my Bachelor's degree, I am excited to apply my skills and experiences. I am a fast learner, always eager to discover new things, and have always enjoyed participating in group projects that can benefit others. I believe that I have a lot to offer and am eager to learn from experienced professionals. <br>
		  During my studies, I gained experience in various programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++, and worked on group projects that honed my teamwork and communication skills.
      I am passionate about programming and love to work on challenging projects that test my skills and I possess a strong passion for technology and problem-solving skills that make me an excellent candidate for a challenging and dynamic role. <br><br>

      <b>Where did I study?</b><br>
      I studied a Bilingual Bachelor's degree (half spanish half english) as Computer Science at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM), where I recently graduated and completed my Bachelor's thesis project with a grade of 9.5/10. The project was a personal climate control system for plants in a personal greenhouse, utilizing cloud computing and IoT technologies to accurately monitor and control growing conditions. I am proud of the practical and effective solution developed, and the new knowledge I acquired through the project. <br>
      I also did an internship where I worked on the migration of a bank's fraud detection system to the cloud, where I gained hands-on experience in cloud technology and machine learning implementation. I contributed to the migration process and implemented data transfer capabilities to improve the system's efficiency and security. <br>
		  Additionally, my experience as an Erasmus+ exchange student at the Norwegian Univerity of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, allowed me to develop cultural awareness and adaptability.<br><br>

      <b>Why did I study Computer Science at UAM?</b><br>
      Growing up, I had a passion for Computer Science that was sparked during a high school subject where I learned the basics of programming. I continued to cultivate this passion and eventually chose to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with the support of my family who recognized my creativity and problem-solving skills. I chose the UAM as it was the only university in Madrid that offered a english bachelors. <br><br>     

      <b>Which are my passions?</b><br>
      Despite my technical interests, I have always had a desire to explore different cultures and help people. In 2017, I participated in a volunteering program in Germany where I helped to restore a walking path in the forest and learned carpentry skills while meeting people from different parts of the world. I also volunteered for a food bank in Spain, encouraging people to donate food to families in need. <br>
      In 2021, I gained valuable experience working as a hostess for Salesland, where I worked on different campaigns convincing customers to join the store club. This experience honed my customer service skills, my ability to communicate with diverse groups, and my outgoing personality. Additionally, I learned how to work with people from different backgrounds and became more open-minded. <br><br>
      
      <!--CS Related-->
		  <b>Which is your favourite language?</b><br>
      As a programmer, I do not have a single favorite programming language. My preference for a particular language depends on the specific project and its requirements. While I tend to enjoy object-oriented programming and have found great use for C in certain projects, I am open to exploring new programming languages and technologies as needed. <br>
      During my bachelor's degree, I worked with a variety of programming languages, including Java, C++, C, Assembly, R and Python the same as SQL, Puppet or VBA. This experience has given me a broad understanding of different programming paradigms and the ability to learn new languages quickly. I also completed several courses in Python, which I find to be a highly flexible language that is well-suited to a wide range of applications. <br>
      My experience with multiple programming languages and my ability to adapt to the requirements of each project has made me a flexible and effective programmer. While I have enjoyed working with certain languages, I remain open to new opportunities and am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field of programming.<br><br>

      <!--Work environment-->
      <b>Working in an international team?</b><br>
	    I would be incredibly comfortable working in an international team. I had my first international experience in 2017, when I was 17 years old, as I did my first volunteering in Enkenbach-Alsenborn, Germany. Thanks to that, I met people from Turkey, Italy, Mexico, Germany, England, Ireland, Belarus, and Ukraine. It was there that I knew that I wanted to meet different people from around the world, and discover different cultures and persons. There, I restore a walking path in the middle of the forest.<br>
	    Nowadays, I just finished my Erasmus in Trondheim and I met a lot of different people from different parts of the world. In the lectures at NTNU, where I was studying, I worked with Norwegians, Germans, Italians, Pakistanis, and Chinese, as well as Spanish.<br>
	    These experiences made me realize that working in an international environment with diverse people can lead to beautiful things. Through these events, I learned how to be part of a team and how, by bringing together different ideas, you can solve problems that would seem impossible if done by yourself.<br><br>
